## Abstract

We consider the problem of state estimation from a few linear measurements, where the state to recover is an element of the manifold $$\mathcal{M}$$ of solutions of a parameter-dependent equation. 
The state is estimated using prior knowledge on $$\mathcal{M}$$ coming from model order reduction. 
Variational approaches based on linear approximation of $$\mathcal{M}$$, such as PBDW, yields a recovery error limited by the Kolmogorov width of $$\mathcal{M}$$. 
To overcome this issue, piecewise-affine approximations of $$\mathcal{M}$$ have also been considered, that consist in using a library of linear spaces among which one is selected by minimizing some distance to $$\mathcal{M}$$. 
In this paper, we propose a state estimation method relying on dictionary-based model reduction, where a space is selected from a library generated by a dictionary of snapshots, using a distance to the manifold. 
The selection is performed among a set of candidate spaces obtained from a set of $$\ell_1$$-regularized least-squares problems. 
Then, in the framework of parameter-dependent operator equations (or PDEs) with affine parametrizations, we provide an efficient offline-online decomposition based on randomized linear algebra, that ensures efficient and stable computations while preserving theoretical guarantees.
