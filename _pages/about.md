Ph.D in applied mathematics at [Ecole Centrale de Nantes](https://www.ec-nantes.fr/) supervised by [Prof. Anthony Nouy](https://anthony-nouy.github.io/).
Engineer at Ecole Centrale de Nantes specialized in applied mathematics and research.

My research topics mainly revolve around dimension reduction, especially in a context of high dimensional function approximation, and inverse problems.
I try my best to promote open science, both through my research work and by disseminating scientific culture to the public.
