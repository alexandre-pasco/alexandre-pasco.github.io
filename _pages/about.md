I am a 3rd year Ph.D student in applied mathematics at [Ecole Centrale de Nantes](https://www.ec-nantes.fr/) supervised by [Prof. Anthony Nouy](https://anthony-nouy.github.io/).
Before that, I Graduated from Ecole Centrale de Nantes where I specialized in applied mathematics and research.

My research topics mainly revolve around dimension reduction, especially in a context of high dimensional function approximation.
I try my best to promote open science, both through my research work and by disseminating scientific culture to the general public.
