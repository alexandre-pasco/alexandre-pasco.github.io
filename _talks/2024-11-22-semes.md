### The SEMES

The aim of the Semaines d'Études Mathématiques - Entreprises et Société (SEMES) is to encourage exchanges between mathematics research laboratories and various socio-economic environments (industry, start-ups, SMEs, large companies, university hospitals, joint research units, associations, local authorities, etc.) through a week of work on problems posed by socio-economic players and requiring innovative mathematical approaches.
The problems, presented and discussed on the first day, are tackled by groups of 4 to 5 young researchers (doctoral students and poѕt-doctoral students). 
Progress will be presented orally on the final day. 
Each group will be supported by more experienced researchers, but retains complete freedom as to the direction of its work.
 
A written summary is submitted to the company at the end of the week. In the months that follow, a report is drawn up and made available to the public (with the company's consent).
 
SEMES is an initiative of [AMIES](https://www.agence-maths-entreprises.fr/public/pages/index.html). They are based on the model of the European Study Group for Industry set up in the United Kingdom in the 1960s and subsequently in a number of European countries.
