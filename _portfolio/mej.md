### The association

MATh.en.JEANS is an association whose aim is to develop twinning schemes between a mathematician and schools, in order to put young people in a research situation and enable pupils and their parents to form an image of mathematics other than that of a selective school subject or a strict and finished scientific field.
For more information on the association, see the [website](https://www.mathenjeans.fr/).

### My contributions

For two consecutive years (2023-2025) I was the Researcher Referent for the middle schools Ernest Renan and Jean Rostand, in Nantes.

My role was to write the topics proposed for the workshop, taking into account the level of the students. 
I accompanied the students' research by following their progress during visits to their schools.
The subjects I proposed are available on my [github](https://github.com/alexandre-pasco/maths-en-jean).

I also took part in the 2024 congress (Nantes) as a member of staff, as well as the 2025 congress (Angers) as chairman for presentations.
