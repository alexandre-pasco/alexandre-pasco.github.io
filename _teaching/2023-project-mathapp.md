## Description

### Matrix completion via optimization on low-rank matrix manifolds

The goal is to approximate an unknown matrix given a limited number of its entries.
We investigate the low-rank approximation format, which results in optimizing a quadratic loss function defined fixed-rank matrix manifolds.

### Inverse problem and dimension reduction

The goal is to approximate an unknown high-dimensional function (e.g. solution of a parameterized PDE) given linear measurements on it.
We investigate the so-called *PBDW* method, which leverage prior linear model reduction (e.g. POD).

### Linear features learning using gradient evaluations

The goal is to approximate a multivariate function given pointwise evaluation of the function and its gradient.
We investigate the so-called *Active-Subspace Method*, which build a linear low-dimensional featuring of the input, certified thanks to Poincar√© inequalities.
